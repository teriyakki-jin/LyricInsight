  # Lyrics Analysis Webpage

  This is a code bundle for Lyrics Analysis Webpage. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/kos13CTaA97SOHB4cElKf2/Lyrics-Analysis-Webpage.

  ## Running the code

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

## Configure API base URL
The frontend calls the Spring Boot backend directly. Create a `.env.local` file (or set an environment variable) with:
```
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080
```
Adjust the URL if your backend runs on a different host/port.

## Run
Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
